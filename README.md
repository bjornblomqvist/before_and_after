# before_and_after

befoce_and_after adds the methods (before?, after?, within_last?, within_coming?) to Time

    2.minutes.ago.after?(Time.now) # => false
  
    Time.now.before?(2.hours.from_now) # => true
  
    2.minutes.ago.within_last?(2.hours) # => true
  
    2.minutes.from_now.within_coming?(2.hours) # => true

Example of where it really improves readability

    email.sent_at.within_last?(48.hours)
    
vs

    email.sent_at > Time.now - 48.hours
